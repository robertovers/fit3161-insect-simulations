# Nectar: Honeybee simulations written in C++

Nectar is a simulation tool used to study Honeybee pollination behaviour. It is written in C++ and uses [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) for graphics components.

The project was developed as part of the final-year Computer Science project at Monash University, during 2022. The project team consists of Jireh Chen, Ethan Cheng, Lucille Grasso & Robert Overs.

## Features
- Efficient engine capable of simulating thousands of bees
- Responsive UI with multiple display options and customisable colours
- Automatic report and documentation generation

## Install

#### Required dependencies
- [CMake](https://cmake.org)

#### Optional dependencies
- [Doxygen](https://doxygen.nl/download.html) (for generating documentation)
- [Python](https://python.org) (for generating simulation reports)

### MacOS

For macOS users with homebrew, both CMake and Doxygen can be installed with:

```
brew install cmake && brew install doxygen
```

Once CMake is installed, clone the nectar repository using:

```
git clone https://github.com/robertovers/nectar.git
```

### Windows

For Windows, CMake binaries can be downloaded at: https://cmake.org/download/.

Doxygen binaries can be found at: https://doxygen.nl/download.html.

Once CMake is installed, clone the nectar repository using:

```
git clone https://github.com/robertovers/nectar.git
```

### Linux

## Usage

Navigate to the `nectar` directory and run:

```
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

The executable will be contained in `build/src`, and can be run with:

```
./build/src/nectar
```

##

Once built, the documentation can be location at `build/src/doc_doxygen`. Opening the `index.html` file within the html folder will load a webpage containing documentation for the project.

## Tests

To run tests, navigate to the build folder and run `ctest`.

Sample test output:

```
