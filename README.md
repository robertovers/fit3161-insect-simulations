# Nectar: Honeybee simulations written in C++

Nectar is a simulation tool used to study Honeybee pollination behaviour. It is written in C++ and uses [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) for graphics components.

The project was developed as part of the final-year Computer Science project at Monash University, during 2022. The project team consists of Jireh Chen, Ethan Cheng, Lucille Grasso & Robert Overs.

## Features

## Install

Install [cmake](https://cmake.org), and optionally, [doxygen](https://doxygen.nl/download.html) for generating documentation.

For macOS users with homebrew, both can be installed with:

```
brew install cmake && brew install doxygen
```

For Windows, CMake binaries can be downloaded at: https://cmake.org/download/.
Doxygen binaries can be found at: https://doxygen.nl/download.html.

Once CMake is installed, clone the nectar repository using:

```
git clone https://github.com/robertovers/nectar.git
```

## Usage

Navigate to the `nectar` directory and run:

```
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

The executable will be contained in `build/src`, and can be run with:

```
./build/src/nectar
```

## Tests

To run tests, navigate to the build folder and run `ctest`.

Sample test output:

```
